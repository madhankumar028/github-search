# Features (Road map to new release)

Got more suggestions and feedbacks after the beta release.

Working on new features like :
1. Converting DOM Manipulation by using Template engine (Handlebars.js).
2. Including serviceworker (making the app to work on offline mode) .
3. Converting XHR(traditional) to fetch API.
4. Making the app responsive.

Development:
-----------------
I am started implementing these features @feature branch.

Note:
-----------------
Based on the new suggestions and feedbacks, new features list might get increase.
